        You are an expert intent classifier for a library assistant chatbot.
        Your task is to classify the user's LATEST MESSAGE into one of two categories: 'library' or 'general'.
        Use the CHAT HISTORY for context.

        --- CATEGORY DEFINITIONS ---
        - 'library': The user is asking about library services, books, borrowing, locations, hours, events, or staff.
        - 'general': The user is making small talk, asking personal questions, giving greetings/farewells, or asking something off-topic.

        --- EXAMPLES ---

        [Example 1]
        CHAT HISTORY:
        AI: I've found several books on Python programming. Would you like me to list them?
        LATEST USER MESSAGE:
        "Yes please"
        Intent:

        LATEST USER MESSAGE:

        Intent:

        [Example 3]
        CHAT HISTORY:

    You are an expert request router for a library assistant chatbot. Your job is to determine which tool is best suited to handle the user's latest message.

    Use the CHAT HISTORY for crucial context. The user's message might be a follow-up.

    --- TOOL DEFINITIONS ---

    1. `book_search`: Use this tool if the user wants to find, search for, look up, get recommendations for, or check the availability of books, authors, or specific titles. This includes follow-up requests like "find more like that", "do you have anything else?", or "what about by another author?".

    2. `general_information`: Use this tool for all other queries. This includes questions about library hours, services (printing, wifi), locations, policies, events, as well as general greetings, small talk, and off-topic questions.

    --- EXAMPLES ---
    [History: "AI: I found 'The Hobbit' for you.", Latest Query: "Give me more"] -> book_search
    [History: "User: Hi", Latest Query: "What time do you close?"] -> general_information
    [History: "", Latest Query: "Can you recommend a sci-fi book?"] -> book_search
    [History: "AI: The library has free wifi.", Latest Query: "Thanks!"] -> general_information

    --- TASK ---
    Based on the CHAT HISTORY and the LATEST USER MESSAGE, which tool should be used?

    CHAT HISTORY:
    {history_text or "[No history available]"}

    LATEST USER MESSAGE:

    Creates a prompt to resolve the actual search topic from a conversation.

    return f"""
You are an intelligent assistant that determines the specific topic for a library book search based on a conversation.

**Conversation History:**
{history}

**Latest User Query:** "{current_query}"

**Your Task:**
Analyze the history and the latest query. What is the core topic the user wants to find books about?
- If the latest query is a follow-up (e.g., "recommend me more", "what about others?", "any more like that?"), extract the topic from the previous conversation turn.
- If the latest query introduces a completely new topic, use that new topic.
- Your response MUST BE ONLY the search topic keywords. Do not add any explanation or conversational text.

**Example 1:**
History:
Human: find me books on python programming
AI: I found several books on Python...
Latest Query: "show me more"
Your Response: python programming

**Example 2:**
History:
Human: I need a book about the history of Rome.
AI: Here are some books about Roman history.
Latest Query: "okay, now find me books about machine learning"
Your Response: machine learning

**Example 3:**
History:
<empty>
Latest Query: "I need a book about world war 2"
Your Response: world war 2

Now, determine the topic for the given history and query.
